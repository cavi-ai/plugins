Use `$mlx-agent:mlx-adopt` to invoke this installed Codex skill explicitly. Codex does not support custom `/mlx-*` slash commands.

# MLX Adopt

Resolve `<skill-dir>` as the absolute directory containing this SKILL.md. Never resolve the bundled executable from the shell working directory.

canonical capability ID: mlx-agent.adopt

Use the durable adoption state owned by the structured CLI. Start with a user-visible state path and requested roles:

`python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/mlx-agent adopt start --state <state-path> --role <role> --json`

If the state already exists or an earlier run was interrupted, continue it with:

`python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/mlx-agent adopt resume --state <state-path> --json`

Report the CLI state and recommendations. Do not recreate adoption policy in this adapter. This operation must not download model weights or change configuration; any later download or mutation requires explicit user confirmation and the reviewed CLI preview.

Tool-use is canonical; agentic is descriptive only. Models verified to invoke supplied tools with schema-valid arguments. Tool-use membership is additional, so a model may retain its primary role. Its recommendation minimum is verified: metadata is not verification, and recommendation requires verified evidence from a schema-valid synthetic runtime tool call. Manifest safety says automatic model downloads are disabled; verification must not pull, install, or download models. Report unsupported runtimes explicitly. If none is verified, recommend none; never use a fallback.
